# Programming with Python

## 1. Introduction

*"Programming with Python"* is both a book and a course held at [Hefei University](http://www.hfuu.edu.cn/english/) ([合肥大学](http://www.hfuu.edu.cn/)).
We here provide all the resources of this course.

The goal of the course and book is to teach undergraduate and graduate students how to program with the Python programming language.
The resources may also be suitable to high school students or whoever else may be interested in the topic.
Our aim is to strike a good balance between theory and practice, leaning more to the practice side.
In particular, we try to teach programming together with some software engineering concepts.
It is the firm opinion of the author that these two cannot be separated.
Teaching programming alone without introducing tools such as static code analysis, unit tests, and enforcing principles such as code style and proper commenting will create bad programmers.
So we discuss these aspects while working our way through the principles of programming.
